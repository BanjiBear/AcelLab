    "A2A Pharmaceuticals designs computationally optimized small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cancer and antibiotic resistant bacterial infections.  Our two oncology programs are focused on inhibiting essential protein-protein interactions in leukemia and in diverse solid tumors. These interactions are critical for cancer progression, but non-essential in normal cells. The antibiotic programs target biosynthetic enzymes in gram-negative bacteria, in pathways not found in humans. The targets selected have no clinically used therapeutics, minimizing susceptibility to resistance; and unlike the numerous follow-on antibiotics currently in development. 
    Our approach integrates interdisciplinary ingenuity with computational tools to design new drug candidates using our proprietary SCULPT platform. Experimentally determined target characteristics guide the selection and placement of fragments to recapitulate key contact points of proteins and/or ligands known to bind. Fragments are incorporated into the target-specific construction of combinatorial in silico libraries, which are designed based on synthetic feasibility. Libraries consisting of thousands to millions of small molecules are iteratively built, and computationally evaluated for potency and optimal ADMET properties. The final selection is made from dozens of iterations, totaling upwards of 100 million compounds.",

The company was founded in 2015 and has locations in both Shanghai, China and New York, NY.

    Products & Services:
    Accutar offers two software packages: 
    Chemi-Net and Orbital. Chemi-Net is a molecular graph convolutional network for accurate drug property prediction. It was recently shown to improve the accuracy of ADME property prediction by a large margin in comparison to the widely-used methods https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06236. 
    Orbital is a deep neural network based docking platform. The prediction accuracy of protein-ligand complex (holo) from ligand free state (apo) structure is significantly higher than current standards. In addition to these tools, AccutarBio offers services in virtual screening for lead discovery; intelligent-SAR for lead optimization and drug property prediction.",

    "AccuVein Inc. is the global leader in vein illumination. The AV400 vein illumination system allows health care professionals to see a map of peripheral veins on the skin’s surface with the goal of improving vascular access procedures including blood draw, IV infusion and blood donation as well as for avoiding veins for cosmetic injectable procedures.

    To see a demonstration of AccuVein in action, please visit www.accuvein.com or call 877-772-5607.
    AccuVein is the world’s only portable, non-contact vein illumination solution. AccuVein is in use at more than 3,000 hospitals and available for sale in over 100 countries worldwide. 

    An Essential Tool
    The AccuVein AV400 displays a map of the vasculature on the surface of the skin.

    AV400 Features 
    • Easy to use. No calibration or adjustment necessary, ready for immediate use. Device can be held at any direction, and works at four or more inches from the skin’s surface. 
    • Small size. The AV400 weighs less than 10 ounces. 
    • Rechargeable battery. Simply place the device in the cradle for charging between uses. 
    • Movement tolerant. Because the AV400 shows the veins in real time, when operated properly, the device can accommodate patient movement. 
    • Viewing modes. In addition to the standard viewing option, the AV400 has an inverse mode which can enhance the visibility of small veins. 
    • Accuracy. Permanently aligned; center line accurate to less than the width of a human hair. 
    • Patient types. AccuVein’s vein illumination will work on a broad range of patients; including neonates, dark skinned, and obese patients. 
    • Medical grade design. The AV400 is non-contact and its medical grade design with no vents or openings allows for the device to simply be wiped clean.

It is the product of more than 10 years’ research at Imperial College London by Acurable’s founder, Professor Esther Rodriguez Villegas, and has been recognised as a breakthrough in respiratory medicine, winning some of the most respected awards in the industry, among them an XPrize and several Innovate UK grants. It has also featured in national and international media, including earlier this year in the BBC Horizon documentary How to Sleep Well with Michael Mosley.

    In 2020 our first product, AcuPebble SA100, became the first medical device in the world to obtain the CE mark for the automated diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea at home, and a few months later the product gained FDA clearance for home sleep apnoea testing in the US. AcuPebble SA100 is now in use within healthcare organisations across the UK and Europe, and will be launching in the USA in the coming months. At the same time we continue our research to develop new products that will fundamentally improve the lives of millions of people suffering from serious chronic conditions such as COPD, Asthma and Epilepsy.",
